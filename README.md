# LeetCode-DSA

This repo contains my solutions to the **[NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/roadmap)**, organized by topic (e.g., Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Dynamic Programming, Graphs, etc.).


## ðŸ“‚ Structure

- Each topic has its own folder.
- Each problem is a separate file with the solution and complexity analysis.

### Example

```
Linked-Lists/
    reverse_linked_list.py
    merge_two_sorted_lists.py
Arrays/
    two_sum.py
    max_subarray.py
```


##  File Format

Inside each file:
- Problem statement (short description + constraints)
- Thought process / approach
- Time & space complexity analysis
- Final solution code


## ðŸš€ Goal

Solve **at least one problem a day** until I finish the full NeetCode 150.
